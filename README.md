This Repo is meant to document my Skills using Powershell for scripting and automation.
I've included tools built from scratch, automated shortcuts and scripts, made to do repetative tasks on my Personal PC.
If you scroll through this, you'll see screenshots of all of the projects here in working.

Job Searching Automation: 
My fingers were getting tired typing my info into job search websites, so I made a couple Powershell and ahk scripts to save 90% of my time applying for cool jobs.
1. Open all the job sites
2. Open my email, open a new mail, and paste my template into the email, ready to send.
3. Open a page with all my resume info
4. Map specific information from a .txt file, to hotkeys, mapped to numbers.
This types the info in and tabs, since they are hotkey numbers, I use the keypad to type in my name, email, phone number, address, etc. All the sites are different, and I would rather paste the info myself, than look through an automated fill in for mistakes. Its not actually saving any time making a python script to read the sites.
